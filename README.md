# Algorithmic-Exercises
Compilation of two algorithmic exercises to review JS concepts. Drawing shapes in ASCII format.

## About this repository
This repository consists of two algorithmic exercises that put into practice the first concepts reviewed in JS, especially the “for” loop. Both exercises have their statements in the form of comments at the beginning of the script. The comments are written in French, which is the language I use for my training as a full stack web developer.
